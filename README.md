[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables secure and efficient communication between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. This repository provides an MCP server that allows LLMs to safely interact with [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) datasets, enabling controlled data analysis while maintaining security.

## What Does This Server Do?

The server provides read-only access to BigQuery datasets through the MCP standard, allowing LLMs to:
- Execute safe, read-only SQL queries
- Inspect dataset schemas
- Analyze data within defined safety limits

### Tools

- **query**
  - Execute read-only SQL queries against BigQuery
  - Input: `sql` (string): The SQL query to execute
  - Safety limits: 1GB maximum bytes billed per query

### Resources

The server provides schema information for each table:

- **Table Schemas** (`bigquery://<project-id>/<dataset>/<table>/schema`)
  - JSON schema information for each table
  - Includes column names and data types
  - Automatically discovered from dataset metadata

## Getting Started
Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. Node.js version 14 or higher installed
2. A Google Cloud project with BigQuery enabled
3. Google Cloud CLI installed
4. Basic familiarity with BigQuery and SQL queries

This server can be used in two ways:
1. Via NPX for quick setup with Claude Desktop
2. Local development for customization and development


### Via NPX
Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bigquery": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@ergut/mcp-bigquery-server",
        "your-project-id",
        "location"  // Optional, defaults to us-central1
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Note: If any dependency fails during installation, you can remove it from the root `package.json` and proceed with the installation.

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Configure Claude Desktop for local development. Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bigquery": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/your/clone/mcp-bigquery-server/src/dist/index.js",
        "your-project-id",
        "location"  // Optional, defaults to us-central1
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

The server uses Google Cloud authentication. Ensure you have:
1. Installed Google Cloud CLI
2. Run `gcloud auth application-default login`
3. Required IAM Roles:
   - Option 1: `roles/bigquery.user` (recommended)
   - Option 2: Both of these roles:
     - `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` - Grants read access to tables
     - `roles/bigquery.jobUser` - Allows query execution
   
   Note: Contact your GCP administrator to get the necessary roles assigned to your account.
